    <!-- Phishing Attack Overview -->
    <div class="section-title">Phishing Attack Overview</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        The "Nigerian Prince" phishing scam is one of the oldest and most infamous social engineering attacks, dating back to the 1990s. The scam involves an email from someone claiming to be a Nigerian prince (or other aristocratic title) who needs help moving a large sum of money. The recipient is promised a large reward for their assistance but is tricked into sending personal information or paying upfront fees to facilitate the transfer.

                <strong>Step 1: Phishing Email</strong>
                <p>The attacker sends a carefully crafted email, usually claiming to be from a royal or wealthy individual in distress, asking for the recipient's assistance in transferring large sums of money.</p>

                <strong>Step 2: Personal Information Request</strong>
                <p>The recipient is asked to provide sensitive information, such as bank account details, or to pay a small fee upfront to cover legal or processing costs.</p>

    <!-- Financial and Societal Impact Section -->
    <div class="section-title">Financial and Societal Impact</div>
    <div class="impact-section">
        <p><strong>Financial Impact:</strong> The Nigerian Prince scam is estimated to have defrauded billions of dollars from unsuspecting individuals worldwide over its long history. While each individual loss may be relatively small, the cumulative impact is staggering, with victims often losing their life savings to the scam.</p>
        <p><strong>Societal Impact:</strong> The attack has contributed to a general sense of distrust in unsolicited email communications. It has also led to the creation of widespread awareness about phishing scams and the importance of verifying sources before engaging with such emails.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- AI-driven Prevention Strategy Section -->
    <div class="section-title">AI in Phishing Prevention</div>
    <div class="ai-prevention">
        <p>AI can play a key role in identifying and mitigating phishing scams like the Nigerian Prince scam. Machine learning algorithms can analyze incoming emails for suspicious patterns, such as irregular language use or requests for sensitive personal information. AI-based email filters can automatically flag or block such emails before they reach the recipient.</p>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) can further assist in detecting common language patterns used in social engineering emails, enabling automated systems to recognize and block fraudulent communication more effectively. Additionally, AI can monitor financial transactions to identify unusual patterns that may indicate a scam in progress, alerting users before they fall victim to the attack.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="section-title2">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="section-content">
        The Nigerian Prince scam is a classic example of social engineering, exploiting human trust and gullibility. While the scam's financial and societal impacts are significant, the development of AI-driven security tools provides a promising solution to detecting and preventing phishing attacks. By combining machine learning, NLP, and automated filtering, platforms can better safeguard users against these types of social engineering scams.
